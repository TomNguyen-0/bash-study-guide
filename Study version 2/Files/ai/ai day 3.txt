What is consistency for Heuristic/monotonicity?
h(n) <= cost(n,action, n') + h(n').
What is the n' in cost(n,action,n')?
It is the estimated cost of h(n'), the next state.
What is the n in cost (n,action,n')?
It is the estimated cost of h(n), the current state.
Every consisten huristic is (a propertie of Heuristic)?
admissible.
A* is guaranteed to be (for trees)?
admissible.
A* is guaranteed to be (for graphs)?
consistent.
What is A-Star search for cost incurred to n?
g(n).
What is A-star search for estimate to goal?
h(n).
What does it mean for h(n) to be consistent?
nondecreasing values of f(n), guarantee best path to n, and final goal node found is optimal
What is completeness?
Holds when there are a finite number of nodes with f(n) < the optimal cost.
What do we set the cost of h(n) for depth first search to?
zero
What is the sum of manhattant distance?
move the piece as if there was nothing in the way.
What is admissible?
There is only one(unique) solution.
