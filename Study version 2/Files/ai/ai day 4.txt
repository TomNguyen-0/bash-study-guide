What is a state node?
paths not usually retained. typically moved only to neightbors of state.
What is "the good"?
low memory usage. for large state spaces.
what is "the bad"?
lose advantages from search-tree retention (backtracking).
What is "Find best state"?
find extrema of objective function f(state).
What is global extrema?
global maximum.
What is local maximum?
local extrema.
What is Hill-climbig search?
greedy search.
what are some problems for hill climbing?
local extrema, ridges, plateaus.
What is stochastic?
assign probabilities related to steepness of choice and pick randomly (slow convergence)
What is first-choice?
generate sccessors randomly, pick the first one that's better than current state.
What is random-restart?
pick a new initial state if we don't find what we are looking for.
what is annealing?
process to harden metals. subject to high heat.
What are the three annealing states?
high energy state, slowly cool, allows molecules to realign (reducing stress)
What is high temperature for annealing?
more likely to pick risky decisions
what is low temperature for annealing?
more likely to pick good decisions.
