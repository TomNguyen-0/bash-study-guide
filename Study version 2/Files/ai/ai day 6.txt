What is a zero-sum game?
what's good for you is bad for me
What is turn-based?
alternating
What is pruning?
removing portions of search tree.
What are the parts for a game search problem?
initial state, player, actions, result, terminal-test, utility
What is a game tree?
exploration of the game search space
What is alpha-beta pruning?
remove subtreees that can't influence the decision
What is move-ordering?
order affects pruning performance
What is cutoff?
don't evaluate all the way to terminal node
What is alpha-beta pruning?
When we are looking for the max value, if there is a value is lower then the current one. You can just throw the smaller child away.
what is killer move heuristic?
iterative deepening search to ply above. use heuristic value to order nodes.
what is transposition table?
stores heuristic of visited states. only store good states.
What is endgames?
reduced search space
what is retrograde search?
backwards minimax search backwards from terminal states
