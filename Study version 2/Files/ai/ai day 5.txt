What is a beam search?
Only keep the k most successful children
what is genertic algorithms search-state node measured?
fitness function
What is the successors for genetic algorithms?
generated from random pair in frontier (population)
How are random paris selected for genetic algorithms?
p(node) = fitness(node) / sum of fitness(i)
What is line search?
double alpha repeatedly until objective function f starts to decrease. choose new direction.
what is alpha when it is too small?
learning slow
what is alpha when it is too large?
might overshoot extrema or gradient change.
What is Newton-Raphson method?
a + h = r
what is a in Newton-Raphson method?

What is h in Newton-Raphson method?
the width of f(a)
what is b in Newton-Raphson method?
the point it intercepts at the x axis
What is r in Newton-Raphson method?
the actual root.
What is contingency plans?
the result of an action such that it returns multiple possible states
